# Ni3D
Traditional 3D hand scanning methods are invasive, expensive, and
often lack the precision needed for healthcare, reverse engineering,
and HCI applications.
• This project introduces a low-cost, non-invasive 3D hand scanner
using Raspberry Pi Zero units and photogrammetry techniques.
• The system uses a wireless array of Pi cameras to capture
synchronized multi-angle images, minimizing motion artifacts.
• A central processing module reconstructs high-resolution 3D
models for use in prosthetics, ergonomic design, and virtual
environments.
• Offers comparable accuracy (≈ 0.62 mm error) to commercial
scanners (~€150,000) at a fraction of the cost. Features modular
hardware, wireless control, and real-time feedback, making it ideal
for research labs, clinics, and educational use.
